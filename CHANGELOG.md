# CHANGELOG

# [Version v1.3.1](https://github.com/intel/xFasterTransformer/releases/tag/v1.3.1)
v1.3.1
## BUG fix
- Fix oneCCL environment is still needed when running in single-rank mode.

# [Version v1.3.0](https://github.com/intel/xFasterTransformer/releases/tag/v1.3.0)
v1.3.0 - Qwen model support enhancement and added support for the SecLLM (YaRN-Llama) model.
## Models
- Introduce SecLLM(YaRN-Llama) model support.
- Integrating the Qwen web demo, enhancing Qwen model support, and fix known issues in the Qwen convert tool.

## Functionality
- Introduce new generation configuration, `repetition_penalty` and `stop_words_ids`.
- Rotary embedding supports BF16 data type now.
- Introduce attention interfaces similar to page attention.
- Add a whitelist to gather timeline events based on filtered events.

## BUG fix
- Fix `libxft_comm_helper.so` can't be found issue in multi-ranks mode.
- Fix assert error in MLP when CAT_MLP opt is enabled.
- Fix a w8a8 crash issue due to buffer size isn't big enough.
- Correct GCC version for AVX512_BF16 instruction set.
- Fix int32 overflow issue for larger size.


# [Version v1.2.0](https://github.com/intel/xFasterTransformer/releases/tag/v1.2.0)
v1.2.0 - Qwen models and much more data types supported.
## Models
- Introduced Qwen models support and added the convert tool for Qwen models.
- ChatGLM3 model is verfied and API supported.

## Performance Optimizations
- Update xDNN to version 1.4.2 to improve performance and support more data types.
- Accelerate first token's generation with BF16-gemm Multi-Head Attention.

## Functionality
- Introduce more data types supports, including `W8A8`, `INT4`, and `NF4`. The hybrid data types between these new data types are supported.
- Add accuracy evaluation script to assess the impact of different precisions on the text generation performance of the model.
- Introduce `XFT_VERBOSE` macro to help profile model performance of each gemm. Set `1` to enable information ouput and default is `0`.  
- Decouple oneCCL and MPI dependencies into a communication helper library. oneCCL environment is no longer needed when running in single-rank mode.


# [Version 1.1.0](https://github.com/intel/xFasterTransformer/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
v1.1.0 - Baichuan models supported.

## Models
- Introduced Baichuan models support and added the convert tool for Baichuan models.

## Performance Optimizations
- Update xDNN to version 1.2.1 to improve performance of BF16 data type with AMX instruction on 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors.
- Improved performance of BF16 data type inference by adding matMul bf16bf16bf16 primitives and optimizing kernel selection strategy.
- Improved performance of the model with unbalanced split allocation.

## Functionality
- Introduced prefix sharing feature.
- Add sample strategy for token search, support temperature, top k, and top P parameter.
- Introduce convert module to xfastertransformer python API.
- Introduced grouped-query attention support for Llama2.
- Auto-detect oneCCL environment and enter single-rank model if oneCCL does not exist.
- Auto-detect oneCCL environment in compilation. If not detected, oneCCL will be built from source.
- Add C++ exit function for multi-rank model. 
- Remove mklml 3rd party dependency.
- Export normalization and position embedding C++ API, including alibi embedding and rotary embedding.
- Introduced `XFT_DEBUG_DIR` environment value to specify the debug file directory.

## BUG fix
- Fix runtime issue of oneCCL shared memory model.
- Fix path concat issue in convert tools.


# [Version 1.0.0](https://github.com/intel/xFasterTransformer/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
This is the 1st official release of xFasterTransformer.ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ‡

## Support models
- ChatGLM-6B
- ChatGLM2-6B
- Llama 1, both 7B, 33B, and 65B
- Llama 2, both 7B, 13B, and 70B
- Opt larger than 1.3B

## Features
- Support Python and C++ API to integrate xFasterTransformer into the user's own solutions. Example codes are provided to demonstrate the usage.  
- Support hybrid data types such as BF16+FP16 and BF16+INT8 to accelerate the generation of the 1st token, in addition to supporting single data types like FP16, BF16, and INT8.
- Support multiple instances to accelerate model inference, both locally and through the network.
- Support Intel AMX instruction on 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors.
- Support 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors with HBM which has a higher memory bandwidth and shows a much better performance on LLM.
- Provide web demo scripts for users to show the performance of LLM models optimized by xFasterTransformer. 
- Support multiple distribution methods, both PyPI and docker images.
